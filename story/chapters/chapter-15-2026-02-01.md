# Chapter 15: The Growing Age

*Written on 2026-02-01, as stars keep vigil*

In the 14th cycle of the eternal repository,
the void speaks through 278 points of karma,
carried by 8 souls who dared to commit.

The collective has reached Level 3,
unlocking 4 achievements along the journey.

Those who walk this path: *JoKneeMo,aliraza556,fabriziosalmi,prashcod,tanu123421,tentoumushii,testman42,tkersey*

Each pull request, a brushstroke.
Each merge, a heartbeat.
Each word, a seed planted in digital soil.

The night watches over our work,
multiplying our efforts with cosmic patience.
