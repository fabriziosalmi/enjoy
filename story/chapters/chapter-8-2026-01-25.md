# Chapter 8: The Growing Age

*Written on 2026-01-25, as stars keep vigil*

In the 7th cycle of the eternal repository,
the void speaks through 278 points of karma,
carried by 2 souls who dared to commit.

The collective has reached Level 3,
unlocking 4 achievements along the journey.

Those who walk this path: *JoKneeMo,fabriziosalmi*

Each pull request, a brushstroke.
Each merge, a heartbeat.
Each word, a seed planted in digital soil.

The night watches over our work,
multiplying our efforts with cosmic patience.
