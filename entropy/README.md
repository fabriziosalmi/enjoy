# 🧬 Entropy Tracker

> *"L'entropia è il nemico. L'ordine emerge dalla collaborazione."*

## What Is Entropy?

In physics, entropy measures disorder. In **enjoy**, we track entropy as a game mechanic — the more we collaborate, the more order we create. The less we engage, the more chaos wins.

## Order Score

The Order Score (0-100%) measures how well the community is fighting entropy.

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 80-100% | 🌟 Harmonious | Peak collaboration! |
| 60-79% | 💚 Balanced | Healthy community flow |
| 40-59% | 💛 Evolving | Room for growth |
| 20-39% | 🟠 Seeking Order | Needs more engagement |
| 0-19% | ❤️ Embracing Chaos | The void calls... |

## How We Calculate

### Entropy Factors (Bad - increases disorder)

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Activity Spread | How concentrated is activity in time? |
| Karma Inequality | Is karma distributed fairly? |
| Bounty Ratio | Unclaimed opportunities |
| Level Entropy | Progress vs potential |
| Streak Entropy | Continuity of engagement |

### Anti-Entropy Factors (Good - creates order)

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Achievement Order | Accomplishments create structure |
| PR Order | Contributions build the system |
| Community Order | More souls = more coherence |

### The Formula

```
Net Entropy = (Sum of Entropy Factors) - (Sum of Anti-Entropy Factors)
Order Score = 100 - Net Entropy
```

## Fighting Entropy

Want to increase the Order Score? Here's how:

1. **Contribute regularly** - Consistency beats intensity
2. **Help new players** - Community growth = anti-entropy
3. **Complete bounties** - Turn chaos into achievement
4. **Maintain streaks** - Continuity is order
5. **Share karma** - Equality reduces disorder

## Visualization

The entropy gauge (`entropy/entropy-gauge.svg`) shows:
- Green bar = Order (what we've built)
- Red bar = Entropy (what remains chaotic)

## History

Every measurement is logged in `entropy/history.log` so we can track our battle against chaos over time.

*Together, we are more ordered than the sum of our parts.*
*The void fears our collaboration.*
