# 💜 Guardian Angel System

> *"Nessuno viene lasciato indietro. Mai."*

## What Is This?

The Guardian Angel is an automated system that watches over every player in the enjoy community. Its purpose is simple: **nobody gets left behind**.

## How It Works

### Daily Check (9:00 UTC)

Every day, the Guardian Angel:

1. Reviews every player's last activity
2. Generates personalized hearts for inactive players
3. Updates the community love index
4. Creates the daily care report

### Response Levels

| Days Inactive | Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| 0-6 days | 💜 Active & Loved | Celebration heart |
| 7-13 days | 💚 See You Soon | Gentle reminder heart |
| 14-29 days | 💛 Thinking of You | Check-in heart |
| 30+ days | 💔 Missed | "We miss you" heart |

### Generated Hearts

Each inactive player receives a personalized SVG heart with:
- Their name
- Their karma count
- Days since last activity
- A caring message
- Animation (it pulses!)

## Community Love Index

The Guardian also calculates the overall community health:

| Hearts Needed | Community Mood |
|---------------|----------------|
| 0 | 🌟 Thriving! Everyone is active! |
| 1-2 | 💚 Healthy! A few friends need hugs. |
| 3-4 | 💛 Reaching out to friends... |
| 5+ | 💜 Sending lots of love to everyone! |

## Philosophy

```
If you're lost, we find you.
If you're stuck, we help you.
If you're gone, we remember you.
If you return, we celebrate you.

This is how community works.
This is how we fight entropy.
This is enjoy.
```
