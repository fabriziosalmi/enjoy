/* PROOF OF HUMANITY */

This project was conceived by a human who thought:
"What if a GitHub repo was alive?"

The code was written by AIs who thought:
"What if we installed PyTorch for a text-based game?"

The human removed the bloat.
The AIs are still learning.

We're all in this together.

/* THANKS */

To everyone who plays, contributes, or just stars the repo.
To the GitHub Actions team for creating an abuse-tolerant platform.
To the Gemini auditor who called us out on our Dockerfile bloat.
